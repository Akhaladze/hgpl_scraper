mechanical stability and elasticity (including crack bridging) for use in flat and textured finishes. Manufactured without the use of APEO* surfactants and no added formaldehyde* or formaldehyde generators*, enabling the formulator to develop coatings for building projects with stringent environmental and building code regulations. The advanced technology combined with its mechanical and dirt-pick-up resistance properties that enables the formulation of anti-carbonation-type coatings suiting a harsh environment and capable of passing many of the elongation, pulloff strength, crack-bridging, CO2 diffusion and water vapour transmission specifications commonly required for this category of coatings. The general formulating space for such a coating based on WDV 2001 ER is around 35 +/-3 % PVC at approximately 40+/-2% volume solids and an applied dry-film thickness of about 140+/-10 microns/coat. Textured finishes can be applied to all vertical masonry surfaces, transforming them from bland expanses of masonry into attractive and durable pieces of architecture. Trowel applied finishes are also employed as a decorative finish for EIFS (External Insulation and Finishing Systems), utilising polystyrene foam as the substrate. The size and shape of aggregates and fillers used have a dramatic effect on texture systems.

Manufactured without the use of APEO* surfactants and no added formaldehyde* or formaldehyde generators*, enabling the formulator to develop coatings for building projects with stringent environmental and building code regulations. The advanced technology combined with its mechanical and dirt-pick-up resistance properties that enables the formulation of anti-carbonation-type coatings suiting a harsh environment and capable of passing many of the elongation, pulloff strength, crack-bridging, CO2 diffusion and water vapour transmission specifications commonly required for this category of coatings. The general formulating space for such a coating based on WDV 2001 ER is around 35 +/-3 % PVC at approximately 40+/-2% volume solids and an applied dry-film thickness of about 140+/-10 microns/coat. Textured finishes can be applied to all vertical masonry surfaces, transforming them from bland expanses of masonry into attractive and durable pieces of architecture.

Can build mid-shear viscosity more efficiently than standard mid-shear builders. It is recommended for acrylic- and styrene/acrylic-based latex coating formulations. Contributes to offer excellent flow and leveling, as well as gloss development, for formulations of both interior and exterior paints. It imparts arheological profile to architectural and industrial coatings similar to that of ACRYSOL\u2122 RM-825, but with the benefit of no added solvent, allowing for ultra-low VOC formulations.",

modified ethylene oxide urethane (HEUR) mid-shear Rheology Modifier for latex paints. New generation, solvent-free, APEOfree, non-ionic rheology modifier. Based upon patented and proprietary technology, this mid-shear builder is offered at 27% solids and supplied at a low viscosity to allow easy pumping and dosing. Can build mid-shear viscosity more efficiently than standard mid-shear builders. It is recommended for acrylic- and styrene/acrylic-based latex coating formulations. Contributes to offer excellent flow and leveling, as well as gloss development, for formulations of both interior and exterior paints. It imparts arheological profile to architectural and industrial coatings similar to that of ACRYSOL\u2122 RM-825, but with the benefit of no added solvent, allowing for ultra-low VOC formulations.", "collection": "default", "dow_prd_substrates": ["Masonry"], "dow_contenttype_hierarchy": ["Products"], "indexeddate": 1695024539000, "filetype": "txt", "dow_producttechnology_hierarchy": ["Additives and Modifiers|Rheology Modifiers and Thickeners", "Additives and Modifiers"], "commonsource": "Products", "dow_hierarchy": ["public"], "sysfiletype": "txt", "language": ["English"], "dow_prd_ph_range": ["Very Acidic (<4)"], "dow_prd_ionic_nature": ["Nonionic", "Nonionic"], "dow_prd_shear_thinning": ["Yes"], "dow_prd_productvisibility": ["XXX_AE,XXX_AF,XXX_AL,XXX_AM,XXX_AO,XXX_AR,XXX_AT,XXX_AZ,XXX_BA,XXX_BD,XXX_BE,XXX_BF,XXX_BG,XXX_BH,XXX_BO,XXX_BR,XXX_BY,XXX_CA,XXX_CD,XXX_CG,XXX_CH,XXX_CI,XXX_CL,XXX_CM,XXX_CN,XXX_CO,XXX_CR,XXX_CY,XXX_CZ,XXX_DE,XXX_DJ,XXX_DK,XXX_DO,XXX_DZ,XXX_EC,XXX_EE,XXX_EG,XXX_ES,XXX_ET,XXX_FI,XXX_FR,XXX_GB,XXX_GE,XXX_GH,XXX_GN,XXX_GR,XXX_GT,XXX_HK,XXX_HN,XXX_HR,XXX_HU,XXX_IE,XXX_IL,XXX_IN,XXX_IQ,XXX_IS,XXX_IT,XXX_JO,XXX_JP,XXX_KE,XXX_KW,XXX_KZ,XXX_LB,XXX_LI,XXX_LK,XXX_LR,XXX_LT,XXX_LU,XXX_LV,XXX_LY,XXX_MA,XXX_MC,XXX_MD,XXX_MK,XXX_ML,XXX_MT,XXX_MU,XXX_MX,XXX_MY,XXX_MZ,XXX_NG,XXX_NL,XXX_NO,XXX_NP,XXX_NZ,XXX_OM,XXX_PA,XXX_PE,XXX_PK,XXX_PL,XXX_PR,XXX_PT,XXX_PY,XXX_QA,XXX_RO,XXX_RS,XXX_RU,XXX_SA,XXX_SE,XXX_SI,XXX_SK,XXX_SL,XXX_SN,XXX_SV,XXX_SZ,XXX_TG,XXX_TH,XXX_TM,XXX_TN,XXX_TR,XXX_TT,XXX_TW,XXX_TZ,XXX_UA,XXX_UG,XXX_US,XXX_UY,XXX_UZ,XXX_VN,XXX_XK,XXX_YE,XXX_ZA"], "sysrowid": 1695024539848375886, "uri": "product://en-us/pdp.acrysol-rm-855-rheology-modifier.450753z.html?productCatalogFlag=1", "syscollection": "default"}, "Title": "ACRYSOL\u2122 RM-855 Rheology Modifier", "Uri": "product://en-us/pdp.acrysol-rm-855-rheology-modifier.450753z.html?productCatalogFlag=1", "PrintableUri": "product://en-us/pdp.acrysol-rm-855-rheology-modifier.450753z.html?productCatalogFlag=1", "ClickUri": "product://en-us/pdp.acrysol-rm-855-rheology-modifier.450753z.html?productCatalogFlag=1", "UniqueId": "42.44306$product://en-us/pdp.acrysol-rm-855-rheology-modifier.450753z.html?productCatalogFlag=1", "Excerpt": "Hydrophobically modified ethylene oxide urethane (HEUR) mid-shear Rheology Modifier for latex paints.

Low surface tension makes it a particularly efficient rinse aid and low foam wetting agent in auto dish detergents, industrial and institutional cleaning, and in cleaning-place (CIP) applications such as food, dairy, and brewery cleaning.
